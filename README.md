## Hi there 👋

I’m Camille Pittet, a **Master's student in SV with a focus in Data Science** at **EPFL**. My work and projects are centered around **machine learning**, **data science**, and **image analysis**. 

### 🗂️ **Previous Projects**

- **Unsupervised Recommendation Analysis:**  
 Developed an efficient movie recommendation system by analyzing synopses using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for unsupervised clustering. Focused on uncovering hidden patterns beyond traditional genres. [[repository](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-padawans.git)]

- **Automated Coin Detection**  
 Conducted a computer vision project for EE-451 for the detection and classification of euro and franc coins, building an automated classification system. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/Project_imageanalysis/blob/ca8c9e9af73ab01da491050c1336f810f3ea0128/Group56%20(5).ipynb)

- **World Values Survey** \
  This data visualization project takes the form of a quiz to determine which country aligns the most with an individual's values. It offers extensive visualization of the World Values Survey Dataset. [Repository](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/data-vizards/)

- **Lab in Signal and Image Processing**
  - [Introduction to image processing](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/lab_signal_processing/blob/main/Assignment%201%20Introduction%20to%20Image%20Processing.ipynb)
  - [Object detection and recognition](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/lab_signal_processing/blob/main/Assignment%202%20Object%20Detection%20and%20Recognition.ipynb)
  - [Object tracking](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/lab_signal_processing/blob/main/Assignment%203%20Object%20Tracking.ipynb)

- **Sarcasm Detection Using Sentiment Analysis:**  
 Explored deep learning for emotional pattern detection in sarcasm from TV show videos. Used multi-modal data (audio, text, and frames) to detect sarcasm. [[repository](https://github.com/camicc/Hatespeech-Detection.git)]

- **Predicting Cocaine Use Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Patients:**  
 Focused on classification, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Lina Dietker at the Laboratory of Experimental Psychopathology and Psychotherapy, University of Zurich. [[repository](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-roc-stars.git)]
