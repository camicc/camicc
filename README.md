## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm Camille Pittet, a **Master's student in SV with a focus in Data Science** at **EPFL**. My work and projects are centered around **machine learning**, **data science**, and **image analysis**. 

### üóÇÔ∏è **Previous Projects**

- **Unsupervised Recommendation Analysis:**  
  - Developed an efficient movie recommendation system by analyzing synopses using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for unsupervised clustering. Focused on uncovering hidden patterns beyond traditional genres. [[repository](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-padawans.git)]

- **Automated Coin Detection:**  
  - Worked on an image analysis project for the detection and classification of euro and franc coins. Built an automated classification system for coin detection. [Python repository coming soon!]

- **Sarcasm Detection Using Sentiment Analysis:**  
  - Explored deep learning for emotional pattern detection in sarcasm from TV show videos. Used multi-modal data (audio, text, and frames) to detect sarcasm. [[repository](https://github.com/camicc/Hatespeech-Detection.git)]

- **Predicting Cocaine Use Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Patients:**  
  - Focused on classification, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Lina Dietker at the Laboratory of Experimental Psychopathology and Psychotherapy, University of Zurich. [[repository](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-roc-stars.git)]
